## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ 
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd cut
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`

### Build for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

The built files will be in the `dist` directory.

## Usage

### 1. Define Materials
- Add materials with codes, names, and specific weights (g/mÂ²)
- Materials are used to calculate roll weights and optimization parameters

### 2. Manage Stock Rolls
- Add available rolls with dimensions (width/length), weights, and batch numbers
- Rolls are automatically grouped by material for optimization

### 3. Create Cut Requests
- Define customer orders with priority levels and quantities
- Requests include material, dimensions, and priority (high/normal/low)

### 4. Optimize Cutting Plans
- Select from 6 different optimization algorithms
- Configure algorithm-specific settings
- View real-time optimization results and comparisons

### 5. Analyze Results
- Review cutting patterns with visual representations
- Compare different algorithms side-by-side
- Export optimization results as JSON

## Algorithm Details

### Bidimensional Algorithm
Standard optimization that considers both width and length dimensions, using a first-fit decreasing approach.

### Waste Minimization Algorithm
Focuses on minimizing material waste using a best-fit approach to reduce leftover material.

### Priority Algorithm
Prioritizes high-priority orders, ensuring they are fulfilled first even if it results in more waste.

### Roll Minimization Algorithm
Aims to use the minimum number of rolls by grouping similar widths and maximizing roll utilization.

### Multi-objective Algorithm
Balances multiple optimization goals (waste, priority, roll usage) with configurable weights.

### Column Generation Algorithm
Advanced algorithm for large-scale problems using iterative pattern generation and optimization.
